# Javascript Projects
These are some of my project made in javascript when I started learning web development.

## Contents
- Tic Tac Toe: classic tic tac toe game.
- A Car game: Old school car race game made with DOM manipulation, with arrow keys as control.
- Speed typing: A Speed typing website that gives users some words to type and then calculates their words per minutes (WPM).
- Image hover: A small function to zoom in on an image when hovering over it, written in javascript, can be done easily with CSS as well but JavaScript goes good.
